        "description":"Hello friends! Please join us for a night of psytrance (prog/fullon/twilight/forest) and techno/tech house and FUN! :D\n\nFeaturing...\n:::: Split & Jaxta ::::\n(MadaBeats Records/ Broken Robot Records) (Israel/Sweden)\nStylistically, their music derives influences from the psy-trance genre and twists into an electro-based spectrum, with distorted synths and a certain rock and roll rawness. Split & Jaxta have been performing around the globe in countries including Israel, Sweden, USA, Mexico, Switzerland and Australia. With massive following every step of the way they hope to conquer a few more destinations. Pleased to have S&J back in San Francisco!!!\n* https://soundcloud.com/split-n-jaxta *\n\nAlso on the lineup!!\n\n:::: No Cliu :::: Orange County, CA\n(Pulsar Music/ Pharmacy Music / Sculpted Sounds):::: [~psytrance~]\nNo Cliu's love for electronic music started as a teenager when he was first introduced to Progressive Trance and Drum and Bass. It wasn't until he moved to Japan at the age of 22, that he discovered Psytrance and its culture. It was in Tokyo that No Cliu discovered his new musical passion and began DJing at various small bars and clubs all over the city. No Cliu remained in Japan for five years and in 2011 he returned to Southern California. Upon his return, he actively looked for a Psytrance scene in the United States.\nThis search led him to groups like Psytribe, Pulsar and Pulse where he would remain active in the scene and later became an official team member of Pulsar.\n* www.soundcloud.com/nocliu *\n\n:::: DJ Goldilox :::: Mt. Shasta, CA\n(Star Camp Shasta, StarSeed Events, California ):::: [~funky twilight/forest~]\nWith a degree in Media and Performing Arts from Massachusetts College of Art, DJ Goldilox aka Goldie began her music career in the Industrial band D.D.T. in Boston back in 1991. This is same Goldilox that started out her dj persona playing drum and bass at Sister SF in 1997, resident Funky Techno dj at the Session in Northern Ireland, regular Techhouse guest dj at the infamous Otherwhirld on Sunday mornings at The End-up in San Francisco, old member of Brass Tax in SF, guest at Scooby-Doo Crew Raves in Texas, and organized way to many Burning Man Camps, festivals, and parties to mention. She also has Breaks, Glitch, and Progressive releases on Sleevin' Records. For the last decade she’s been playing funky forest/psychedelic trance. Now she and her husband DJ Aluxes are organizing events as StarSeed Events.Star Camp is a Psytrance event on 120 acres of private property, about 30 miles from Mt. Shasta, California\n* www.starcampshasta.com *\n* www.mixcloud.com/goldiesirois *\n:::: Khromata :::: Bay Area, CA\n(Pulse SF/ Iboga Records) [~ psy prog ~]\n :::: Mr. Chris Tobal :::: [Pulse SF]\n:::: Seventh Sign :::: [TFSF/Phoria]\nSeventh Sign is the Psychedelic Trance moniker of Jonn Connor, a rising star in the San Francisco Trance circuit. Throughout 2017, Jonn Connor started checking off all of the major clubs within the city and as the new year approached, Seventh Sign was born. \nWith roots in the underground, the first Seventh Sign set that surfaced was at a secret renegade party with views of the Golden Gate bridge and the full moon reflecting off of the pacific ocean. Inspired by the event, he went straight in to the studio to create his first single to debut. Vibrations and creative clarity were the results of that epic night which sparked the idea to produce and debut a new tune every show that he performs at. With big things to come, Seventh Sign is an artist worth having on your radar!\n\n:::: Leonardo Barcellos :::: [DaleCali BR]\n\nBack room hosted b y DaleCali BR!\nBrazlian Bass/ Tech House / Techno\nValber S\nLauro Afonso\nRodolfo Grellert\nPhasemode\n\nVisuals by Samadhi Vision\n\n21+ w/ID\n$20 at the door\n9 pm - 4 am\nF8 1192 Folsom\n\nSee u on the trance floor! :D",

It was our first Burn and also our first time on the Robot Heart bus so being involved in the 10 year anniversary was a big honour which we’re really grateful for. We got to play as the bus drove out from base camp into Deep Playa and seeing all those people riding alongside on their bikes while we played was truly unique and memorable. Big thanks to all the Robot Heart team and everyone who was there for co-creating such a special experience. See you in 2018!!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/acid-mondays\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/AcidMondays\n\nPhoto:  John Dill",
